How to handle output options?
  * Individual properties in renderer(/others?)
  * OutputOptions class that is passed into renderer -> stateless renderer!
  * Perform whitespace interpretation (for alignment)
    * when the cell is create -> cell stores trimmed contents
    * when rendering -> cell stores original contents

TODOs in tests
