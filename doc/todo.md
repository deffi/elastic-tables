  * TODOs in tests
  * Align cells (based on leading/trailing whitespace)?
    * We my want to allow cells to start/end with whitespace
  * Unconditionally provide elastic_tabs.io.stdio/stderr

Project:
  * Rename? With cell alignment, it goes beyond elastic tabs
    * tab-les / tab_les
    * elastic-tables
  * Publish package
  * Auto-publish via GitHub actions

Alignment:
  * Control:

    * Consider spaces when doing alignment?

Escape sequences:
