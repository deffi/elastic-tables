  * TODOs in tests
  * Different line separators (\n, \r\n)
  * Align cells (based on leading/trailing whitespace)?
    * We my want to allow cells to start/end with whitespace

Project:
  * Rename? With cell alignment, it goes beyond elastic tabs
    * tab-les / tab_les
    * elastic-tables
  * Publish package
  * Auto-publish via GitHub actions

Alignment:
  * Control:
    * Keep trailing spaces from original?
    * Consider spaces when doing alignment?

Escape sequences:
  * Which escape characters are easily accessible?
  * Which unicode escape characters exist?
